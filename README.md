Run Program using Elmia.py

A platforming game I made in grade 11 using Python 2 and Maplestory sprites
This is something I made a long time ago. There my be some sprite errors since I had to move around some sprites for GitHub.
It is the first major project I did in terms of code and it wasn't too bad. 

My goals of this project were:
  1. experiment with object interactions
  2. experiment with multi-menus
  3. experiment with creating mapdata and highscore boards
  3. practice Python 2 and pyGame

This game uses mechanics such as:
  - teleporting instead of jumping
    - consumes energy to teleport
    - you teleport to your fairy friend
  - interactions with a hostile animal 
  - energy orbs that refill energy

Things to improve:
  - more maps
  - improve clunkiness of controls and graphics
  - fix graphic error displayed in console
